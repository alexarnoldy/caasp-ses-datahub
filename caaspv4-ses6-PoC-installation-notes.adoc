### CURRENT STAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT: Rapidly changing, highly incomplete, based on a four node configuration, though only three nodes are available at the time of this writing, likely brittle do to lots of automation based on this specific configuration.
#### Last updated: 2019.10.10, PM PDT

#### This document is a strictly guided, step-by-step implementation of a specific configuration based on the SUSE Enterprise Storage 6 Deployment Guide: https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4/single-html/caasp-deployment/
* This specific configuration is based on four nodes:
** Administrative Workstation - VM or bare-metal host
** Four OSD Nodes - bare-metal hosts
** Three Monitor Nodes - collocated with the first three OSD Nodes
** One RGW Node - collocated it the fourth OSD Node
#### Format will be to create SES6 PoC installation notes (as of yet not created) here, then link https://github.com/alexarnoldy/caasp-ses-datahub/blob/master/caaspv4-installation-notes.adoc

CAUTION: All changes to the CaaSP4v procedures will be made in the linked document. All changes to the SES6 procedures will be made here.

.Architecture for this run is only based on three nodes, yet doc will be written to support four nodes
* Monitors will run on the three nodes alongside the OSDs
* A RGW will run on the fourth node (third node in this architecture)
