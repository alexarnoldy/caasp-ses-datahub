* Host NIC cannot be in any bridges
** Need to test to see if a host IP can be applied to the bridge after it has been created
** Need to test to see if the bridge can be built on top of a bond

TIP: Run commands as root

 `vi /etc/sysctl.conf`

* Add:
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-filter-pppoe-tagged = 0
net.bridge.bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged = 0

`sysctl -p`

`zypper -n in bridge-utils`
* To get brctl
`zypper -n in net-tools-deprecated`
* To get ifconfig
`zypper -n in vlan`
* To get vconfig for configuring VLANs on the bridge

`brctl addbr br0`

`vconfig add br0 241`

`ifconfig br0 up`
`ifconfig br0.241 up`
`brctl addif br0 eth1`
`ifconfig eth1 up`

* Use virt-manager to add a new network device with "Specify shared device name", then type `br0`

* When the VM boots up, it will have a single NIC, which is untagged o the native VLAN
** Use `yast lan` to add VLAN241 and assign an IP address
