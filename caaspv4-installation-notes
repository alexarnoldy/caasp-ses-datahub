cp -p autoinst.xml worker1.xml
vi worker1.xml
* Change 105 (the IP of the base node) to 106 for <ipaddr>
* Change <hostname> from infra5 to worker1
* scp to deployment host: scp worker1.xml admin@deployer.caaspv4.com:/home/admin/autoyast_templates/worker1.xml

.On the Deployment host:
* Set up docker
Launch nginx container: docker run --name mynginx  -v /home/admin/autoyast_templates:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -P -d nginx:latest
* Take note of the network port assigned to nginx
